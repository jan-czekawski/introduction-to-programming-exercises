# OAuth 2

# OAuth stands for "Open Authorization"
# Open standard protocol that provides simple and secure authorization for different
# types of apps

# Allows providers to give access to users without any exchange of credentials

# Authorization framework that enables apps to get limited access to suer accounts
# on http service like FB, GitHub, TT etc.

# Problems with Password Approach:

# Users have to share credentials
# Not secure and intrusive
# Hard to maintain when you authorize many apps(change password at provider - eg FB - clients need to be updated)
